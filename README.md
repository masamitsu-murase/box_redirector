# ![Box Redirector](./extension/images/logo.png) Box Redirector

## Overview

Box Redirector is a browser extension that enables seamless integration between Box Drive and the Box web application.

When you access a URL such as:

`https://app.box.com/folder/0?box_redirector_path=C:/Users/username/Box/somefolder/sample.txt`

Box Redirector automatically redirects you to the corresponding page for `somefolder/sample.txt` inside Box, allowing you to open files or folders in the Box web app directly from your local Box Drive path.

**Note:** This extension uses undocumented Box APIs. It may stop working if Box changes their service or API specifications.
